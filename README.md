Q: Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

A: The Weight Tracking Application was developed with the primary goal of helping users monitor and log their weight consistently over time. This mobile application serves as a personal health companion, making it easy for users to track changes, remain mindful of their fitness goals, and maintain healthy habits. Designed with user needs in mind, the app addresses the challenge of inconsistent weight logging by providing an accessible and intuitive platform for entry and review of weight data. Features such as daily or weekly weight entry, a scrollable history log, and SMS-based feedback (if enabled) work together to enhance motivation and health awareness.


Q: What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

A: To support these user needs, several key screens and features were integrated into the app. The user journey begins with a splash screen that welcomes the user and transitions smoothly into the SMS permission screen. This screen ensures that proper access is granted before enabling features that rely on SMS functionality. Following this, the main menu serves as a central hub for navigation. From there, users can access the weight entry screen, where they can input and save their current weight. A highlight of the app is the weight history screen, implemented using a RecyclerView, which displays all past entries in a clean and scrollable format. The user interface was designed to be minimalistic and intuitive, with clearly labeled buttons, easy-to-navigate menus, and responsive layouts that adapt to various screen sizes. These thoughtful design choices contributed to a user-centered experience that is both accessible and efficient.


Q: How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

A: From a development standpoint, the app was built with modularity and maintainability in mind. The process involved creating separate Java classes for core components such as MainActivity, DataActivity, and HistoryActivity. Key development strategies included using structured code, clear naming conventions, and modular logic separation to simplify testing and future updates. RecyclerView was chosen to display dynamic historical data efficiently, and runtime permission checks were added to handle SMS operations securely. Best practices in Java were followed throughout, ensuring a clean and scalable codebase. These techniques not only enhanced the current app but also serve as a reusable foundation for future mobile development projects.
